Velnota hosts the world's ideas. Products start and thrive on Velnota,
so we get why you're pretty excited to get rolling. You want to market
your product on this showcase, but is it worthy? Will it change everyone's
lives, or will it change the life of a single soul? Do you think people
want to purchase your product? Is the idea great? If it started and was
developed on Velnota, then <b>of course</b> it is!
So how do you get started?

					<h3>Recognition</h3>
				</header>
				<p>All products on Velnota are great. We want you to showcase it cleanly
to the world. Once your product has been approved, it'll appear on the frontpage. But you've
got a pretty big task up ahead of you. You'll be creating a mini blog post about the
product and what impact it'll make -- on us, you, and others around the world. Prepare this
post with some images, perhaps a video, or just a simple talk about your product. It's
cool, we'll love it, and the floor is yours!</p>
