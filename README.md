# Created On Velnota

A showcase of the coolest, greatest, and most visionary-centric
products created, developed, iterated, and persist on Velnota. 

If you think you have an amazing product that was developed 
through Velnota, fill out a GitHub issue, and we'll take a look!
If it deserves a spot, we'll create a PR/draft to see if you like
the look, so we can show the world!

### FAQ

* No, ideas don't count

As much as we love ideas, they should first be developed, shared,
and thought through on Velnota itself. It's the perfect place to
get people to view your idea, develop it further, and talk through
more in-depth.

* Why showcase products not from Velnota?

Even though we showcase our own products on a
[separate website](https://products.velnota.com/), we think we can
help out fellow creators out by allowing them to showcase on this platform
to thousands of people around the world!
