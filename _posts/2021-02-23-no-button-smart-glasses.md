[The original Velnota thread for this idea](https://velnota.com/wall/note/1240261551236225/)

Steve Jobs famously said "Who wants a stylus? You have to get 'em, put 'em away,
you lose 'em. Yuck! Nobody wants a stylus." Then iPhone was revolutionized the
phone industry. Google, Facebook, Intel, and Microsoft continue to develop new
smart glasses, but they have some kind of scroll wheel for volume, buttons for
answering calls, and lasers for eyes? Yuck! Nobody likes buttons.

At Velnota, we're developing new smart glasses that works based on hand gestures.
Saw a restaurant and want to know its ratings? "Grab it with your hands" in midair,
and we'll display reviews for you. Got a call while on the road? "Knock on a door"
in midair to decline (because you should be focusing on the road; otherwise, accept
the call).

If you really want to intrude on people's privacy, you can add custom gestures
and code to take a picture of a person's face, do a lookup on Google, and find
out all their social media, name, address, and voter information (that's how
you know everything) and load it on your phone for quick viewing.

This is the only smart glasses that makes you look normal and not like a geek.
We want people to say "Hi" to you and not think you're a hacker or some
privacy intrusive peeper. No button smart glasses.
